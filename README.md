# The purpouse of this repository was to understand how branches, commits, merging and pull request work
# i had to read the intructions multiple times and make serious amounts of attemps to get it to work (as you can see in my document, i made a lot of mistakes)
# i also used the webpage provided with the steps more detailed and guide myself throught it, i also used the help of AI to understand the comands, aside from that, i used the help of a friend to understand github and repositories.
